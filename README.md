# A Game of Life adaption on Java

Note: I'm pretty sure I got it to work, but I never came to see the actual cluster, and I'm reaaally not interested in getting involved with Java graphic libraries. So, with that in mind, I'm moving to Javascript 😏

## Compilation

`javac Game.java`

## Execution

`java Game`
